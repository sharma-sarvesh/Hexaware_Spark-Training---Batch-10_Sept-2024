## Activities and Learning Approach
The training was hands-on, with practical exercises designed to apply our newly learned skills:

- **Role Play Scenarios**:
  - We enacted various workplace situations to practice and refine our communication, collaboration, and conflict management skills.
  - **Example 1**: Stella, a diligent employee, frequently arrived late to meetings, affecting team morale. We role-played a scenario where the team discussed the impact of her tardiness and how to address it constructively.
  - **Example 2**: Laksh, distracted by his phone during a colleague's update, needed to reassess his communication approach. We explored how to remain engaged and attentive in conversations.

- **Case Studies**:
  - We analyzed real-world scenarios, fostering critical thinking and problem-solving.
  - **Scenario 1**: Maria, a new bank recruit, felt pressured by constant observation from Norah, a seasoned employee. We discussed strategies to build mutual trust and reduce performance anxiety.
  - **Scenario 2**: Daisy frequently took unplanned leaves due to illness, leaving colleagues to handle her tasks. We examined how Daisy could better communicate and take responsibility for task outcomes.

- **Storytelling Activity**:
  - In teams of 4 members, we created and narrated stories using a structured approach. Each story included character introduction, plot, climax, moral, and pictures.
  - **Example Story**: *The Wise Parrot and the Foolish King*
    - **Characters**: King Ranjit, Moti (the wise parrot), Minister Dev, and Prince Arjun.
    - **Plot**: King Ranjit craved constant praise but was blind to the struggles of his kingdom. Moti, the talking parrot, spoke the truth and helped the king see the errors of his ways.
    - **Moral**: A wise leader listens to the truth, even when it is hard to hear.
    - This activity helped enhance our creativity, teamwork, and storytelling skills.
